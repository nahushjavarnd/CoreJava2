//	Default methods are introduced to add extra features to current interfaces without disrupting their existing implementations.
// For example, stream() is a default method which is added to Collection interface in Java 8. 
// If stream() would have been added as abstract method, then all classes implementing Collection interface must have implemented stream() method which may have irritated existing users.
